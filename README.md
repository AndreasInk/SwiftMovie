## ðŸ˜€ Welcome to SwiftUIMovie...

### A framework that renders SwiftUI views as a video to create amazing promotional material for your apps

# **This is still in alpha**

### âœ… Features

- Familiar faces, new features
- Animate views that render into a video

### ðŸš€ Getting Started

```swift
import SwiftUIVideo

Movie(length: 30 * 3) {
      IntroView()
              .show(at: 0)
        }
```

**Movie**: Movie renders your content as a video

Length: 30 frames per second multiplied by 3 seconds (3 seconds worth of video)

**some view:**

show: has parent element appear at a set frame

### To run...

#### Add a directory called TEST in your downloads directory and then simply press build and the app will create a video from your code

(this will be refined after Alpha)
